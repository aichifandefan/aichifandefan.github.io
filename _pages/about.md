<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I’m a senior student majoring in Robotics Engineering at [Guangzhou University](https://www.gzhu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes：
- **Machine Learning**
- **computer vision**
- **music generation**
-  **medical image processing**

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Huang](https://jd.gzhu.edu.cn/info/1150/3954.htm) from Guangzhou University.

You can find my CV here:[ Haizhou Xu’s Curriculum Vitae](../files/CV.pdf).

- [Hyperbolic Music Transformer for Structured Music Generation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10070602?denied=)
- Wenkai Huang, Yujia Yu, **Haizhou Xu**, **IEEE Access**
- This paper proposes a Hyperbolic Music Transformer model, which considers the hierarchy in music and models the structured components of music in hyperbolic space. Meanwhile, in order for the network to have sufficient capacity to learn music data with hierarchical and power regular structure, a hyperbolic attention mechanism is proposed, which is an extension of the attention mechanism in hyperbolic space based on the definition of hyperboloid and Klein model.
